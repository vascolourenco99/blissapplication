# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### `What packages I used`

I use react-spinners in my React projects to display loading indicators while my application fetches data from an API. This package provides pre-built components that are easy to use and can save me time. By using these components, I can ensure consistency across my application's loading spinners.
`npm install --save react-spinners`


When I want to build a multi-page application, I turn to react-router-dom for its routing functionality. This package provides components like Route and Link that make it easy for me to define my application's routing logic. With react-router-dom, I can display different components or pages based on the URL, giving my users a seamless experience.
`npm install --save react-router-dom`


Finally, I rely on @fortawesome/fontawesome-svg-core, @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons, and @fortawesome/react-fontawesome to provide Font Awesome icons in my web applications. These packages give me access to a collection of solid icons that are commonly used in web development. @fortawesome/fontawesome-svg-core provides the core functionality for using Font Awesome icons, while @fortawesome/react-fontawesome provides React components for displaying them. By using these packages, I can easily add high-quality icons to my projects without having to design them from scratch.
`npm install @fortawesome/fontawesome-svg-core @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons @fortawesome/react-fontawesome`


### `Installation`
To use this project, please follow these steps:

Install dependencies by running npm install.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
